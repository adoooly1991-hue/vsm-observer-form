  defects:
    high:
    - "At {step_name}, the first-pass yield gap is evident: defects at {defect_pct:.1f}%\
      \ (>{defect_target:.1f}%). This is driving rework loops and latent WIP between\
      \ {prev_step} \u2192 {step_name}."
    medium:
    - Defects at {step_name} near the threshold ({defect_pct:.1f}% vs {defect_target:.1f}%).
      Tighten SPC and error-proofing to prevent drift.
  waiting:
    high:
    - 'Queueing in front of {step_name} is significant: estimated waiting {wait_min:.0f}
      min exceeds cycle time ({ct_sec:.0f} s). This indicates a bottleneck or flow
      imbalance.'
    medium:
    - Intermittent queues observed before {step_name}; monitor for starved/blocked
      intervals and re-balance as needed.
  inventory:
    high:
    - Excess WIP ({wip_units:.0f} units) between {prev_step} and {step_name} ties
      up cash and space, raising handling risk and aging exposure.
    medium:
    - WIP buffer ahead of {step_name} exceeds target. Right-size buffer via pull signals
      and leveled release.
  overproduction:
    high:
    - '{step_name} operates in push mode without a consumption signal, increasing
      FG/WIP exposure and masking process issues.'
    medium:
    - Push scheduling observed at {step_name}. Introduce pull/CONWIP to align output
      to takt.
  transportation:
    high:
    - "Material handling intensity is elevated around {step_name} (moves={layout_moves},\
      \ distance\u2248{distance_m} m). Each move adds non-VA time and damage risk."
  motion:
    high:
    - Operator motion at {step_name} exceeds ergonomic targets (~{walk_m_per_unit}
      m/unit). Re-layout point-of-use tools and parts to reduce travel.
  overprocessing:
    high:
    - "Non\u2013value-add steps detected at {step_name} (redundant checks/data entry).\
      \ Streamline to first-time-right checks only."
  talent:
    high:
    - 'Non-utilized talent at {step_name}: issues are solved locally without feedback
      loops; suggestions not institutionalized.'
  safety:
    high:
    - Recorded {safety_incidents} safety incidents at {step_name}. This introduces
      immediate risk to people and unstable flow conditions.
    medium:
    - Safety near misses noted at {step_name}. Formalize hazard controls and reinforce
      standard work.
